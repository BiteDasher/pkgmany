# Attention
This script is in early alpha. There may be some bugs. Also, if this project grows large, I will completely rewrite the code and invite other developers. But you can already help by messaging me in Telegram. And yes, this script is not of the best quality, but I'm trying to make things easier with my knowledge. Thank you.
